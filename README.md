# kubernetes-ftw

*The purpose of this **unfinished** repository is to document my Kubernetes journey, and nerd-out!*

## To Do:

## Learning Material:
- [x] [Docker Certified Associate (A Cloud Gurl)](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/6b00566d-6246-4ebe-8257-f98f989321cf/overview)
- [x] [Learn Kubernetes by Doing (A Cloud Guru)](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/82b39fac-b9f7-43d1-8f52-6a89efe5202f/dashboard)
- [ ] [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)

## Lessons Learned:
- I completed the ACG Docker course as a container refresher before diving into Kubernetes
- The Udemy course was hard to follow when I had zero hands-on experience
- After a few videos in, I pivoted to the ACG Learn Kubernetes by Doing course to get my hands dirty
- This was a great move!
- The Udemy course is a GREAT resource
